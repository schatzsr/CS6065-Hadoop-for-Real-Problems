#### Working on problems:

**_Twitter:_**

1) [Chris McVeigh] What hour of the day does @PrezOno’s tweet the most on average, using every day we have twitter data?  
Include a plot of the expected number of tweets for each hour of the day, for those he did tweet.  
For example if Ono tweeted once every day at 12:30PM, his expected number of tweets between 12 and 1 would be 1.  
If he alternates between 2 and 3 tweets per day, his average would be 2.5.

2) [Anthony Kleiser] What day of the week does @PrezOno tweet the most on average?  Use the same example as in #1 but for days of the week.

3) [Sean Schatzman] How does @PrezOno’s tweet length compare to the average of all others?  What is his average length?  All others?

5) [Anthony Kleiser] What twitter user tweeted the most?  What is the top 5 longest tweeters?  Bottom 5?

6) [Chris McVeigh] For each day of the week, what was the most mentioned hashtag?  Hour of the day?

10) [Sean Schatzman] For each day, what was the most retweeted or most favorited tweet?
